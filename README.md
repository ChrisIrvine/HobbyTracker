# HobbyTracker

## What is this project?
This project is intended to help me learn AngularJS, PrimeNG and potentially TypeScript in addition. It is intended for my internal use only, but by all means please clone the source 
code and use it to track your own hobby projects. Could I use a simple Google Sheets or Excel Spreadsheet to do the same job. Absolutely. But where is the fun and learning in that. 
Personally, this hobby tracker will be used to track the progress of my Warhammer 40k painting and collection, with the hope that this will help me delve through my "Pile of Potential" 
and paint up more miniatures.


## Installation & Running
Installation/running instructions to come once there is something to install/run. 


## Features
Here is a list of features that constitute the minimal viable product for this app (as a result this will all be based around Warhammer 40k):
- Add a unit
- Duplicate a unit
- Remove a unit
- Change the "status" of a unit
- Prioritise units (for each status stage)
- Display units in a visually appealing way (rather than having "Intercessor Squad" display a stock image of the unit)
