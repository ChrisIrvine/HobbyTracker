# HobbyTracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.2.
## About

### What is this project?
This project is intended to help me learn AngularJS, PrimeNG and potentially TypeScript in addition. It is intended for my internal use only, but by all means please clone the source code and use it to track your own hobby projects. Could I use a simple Google Sheets or Excel Spreadsheet to do the same job. Absolutely. But where is the fun and learning in that. 

Personally, this hobby tracker will be used to track the progress of my Warhammer 40k painting and collection, with the hope that this will help me delve through my "Pile of Potential" and paint up more miniatures.

### Features
Here is a list of features that constitute the minimal viable product for this app (as a result this will all be based around Warhammer 40k):
- Add a unit
- Duplicate a unit
- Remove a unit
- Change the "status" of a unit
- Prioritise units (for each status stage)
- Display units in a visually appealing way (rather than having "Intercessor Squad" display a stock image of the unit)

## Instructions

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
